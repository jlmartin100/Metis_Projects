## MTA Turnstile Traffic Analysis

### Project Description:

The prompt for the project was an email from a fictional organization, Women Tech Women Yes(WTWY), requesting data analytics support.  They wished to identify the MTA turnstiles with the highest traffic, in order to place street teams for lead generation for fundraising and a gala ticket giveaway.

### Features and Target Variables

### Data Used 
**Source**:     [http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).  

**Date range**: April 29, 2019 - June 3, 2019.  

We chose this date range based on the following assumptions:

1) The gala would only occur in a post-COVID return to normal movement and gathering
2) Data prior to 2020 would be needed in order to analyze normal traffic patterns
3) Since the gala would occur in early summer, data just prior to the early summer period was desirable.

### Tools Used 
  Pandas
  Matplotlib
  Seaborn
  The map generator at [https://www.subwayridership.nyc/](https://www.subwayridership.nyc/)
  
### Possible Impacts:

In the fictional scenario given by the prompt, our analysis would support WTWY in building their e-mail leads list to maximize their fundraising, invite a broad range of gala guests, and potentially invite gala guests to their programs promoting the inclusion of women in the technology sector.
